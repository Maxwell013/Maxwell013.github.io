        <h2 class="project-title"><i>FIRST</i>, an introduction</h2>
        <div class="project-text">
          <p>I started my programming journey as a member of my school's <strong>FIRST Lego League</strong> (FLL) team. Delving into the basics of coding and robotics within this dynamic and engaging environment ignited my curiosity for technology and problem solving. From building and programming small robots to complete various tasks, I quickly developed a passion for the creative possibilities of programming.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This early experience paved the way for my transition to the <strong>FIRST Robotics Competition</strong> (FRC) team. Here, I found myself immersed in a world of real-world programming challenges and engineering marvels. Collaborating with teammates, I tackled complex problems, from optimizing robot movements to integrating sensors and systems for precise control.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Being part of the FRC team taught me valuable lessons in precision, efficiency, and <strong>teamwork</strong>. Working under pressure during competitions, I honed my skills in <strong>troubleshooting</strong>, debugging, and optimizing code for peak performance. Every challenge became an opportunity for growth, pushing me to think critically and innovate solutions in a fast-paced environment.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Today, as a programmer, I draw upon the <strong>foundation</strong> laid by my experiences with the FLL and FRC teams. They not only sparked my passion for programming but also instilled in me the resilience and adaptability needed to thrive in the ever-evolving field of software development.</p>

        <h2 class="project-title">Formal Education</h2>
        <div class="project-text">
          <p>My passion for programming ignited during my time in secondary school, where I immersed myself in the world of robotics. It was here that I first encountered <strong>Python</strong>, a versatile and accessible programming language that would become my gateway into the world of coding. Python's simplicity and flexibility allowed me to rapidly progress, empowering me to explore various aspects of programming with ease.</p>
          <br>
          <p>During my first semester as a computer science student, I focused on mastering the basics of Python. This <strong>foundational</strong> course provided me with the opportunity to delve deeper into the language. Through a combination of theoretical learning and practical exercises, I solidified my understanding of Python's core concepts, laying a strong groundwork for my future studies.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In my second semester, I embarked on a new learning journey as I transitioned to <strong>C++</strong>, a powerful and widely-used programming language. Here, I delved into the principles of <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> (OOP), gaining a deeper understanding of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. By applying these concepts in practical projects and assignments, I honed my skills in software design and development, building upon the solid foundation established during my first semester.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As I look back on my formal education thus far, I am grateful for the opportunities that have shaped my journey as a computer science student. From my humble beginnings in secondary school to my current pursuits in college, each experience has contributed to my growth and development as a programmer. </p>

        <h2 class="project-title">This website</h2>
        <div class="project-text">
          <p>This portfolio website represents my first complete project from start to finish. Built entirely with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, it serves as a platform to showcase my skills and projects.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Creating this website was a significant milestone for me, marking my transition from learning the basics of web development to building a complete project independently. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into <strong>web development</strong> best practices, including responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and user experience considerations.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Though my primary focus may not be on web development, I recognized the importance of understanding the fundamentals of creating a <strong>website</strong> in today's digital age.
